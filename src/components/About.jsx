                Hello! I'm Mohinuddin Razi, a passionate and driven Computer
                Science and Engineering student. Technology has always been my
                playground, and I thrive on the challenges it presents. With
                each line of code, I'm shaping the digital world to make it more
                efficient, accessible, and fun.I'm constantly exploring new
                technologies to stay at the forefront of innovation. What
                excites me most about CSE is its potential to solve real-world
                problems. Whether it's creating user-friendly applications,
                optimizing processes, or delving into the realms of artificial
                intelligence, I'm dedicated to using technology to make a
                positive impact on society. Feel free to explore my portfolio to
                get a sense of my style and capabilities. If you'd like to
                collaborate or have a project in mind, don't hesitate to
                contact. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and bring
                fresh ideas to life.
